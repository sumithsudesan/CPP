Job Queue System in C++
Overview
This project implements a job queue system in C++ where jobs can be added to a queue and executed by worker threads. Each job goes through a series of states: Initialization, Waiting, Running, Success, Failure, and Cleanup. The system ensures that jobs are executed by threads, with a limit on the maximum number of concurrent threads. If there are no available threads, jobs wait in the queue until a thread becomes available.

Design

Design Patterns
	Producer-Consumer Pattern: The producer (job submitter) adds jobs to the queue, and the consumer (thread pool) processes these jobs.
	State Pattern: Each job has a state that dictates its behavior and transitions to other states.
	Thread Pool Pattern: Manages a fixed number of threads to avoid the overhead of creating and destroying threads frequently.
Synchronization
	Mutex: Used to protect access to shared resources like the job queue.
	Condition Variable: Used to notify threads when a new job is added to the queue or when a job is completed.

Key Components
1. Job
	Description: Represents a unit of work with different states.
	States:
		Initialization
		Waiting
		Running
		Success
		Failure
		Cleanup
	Responsibilities: Manage its own state transitions and execute work when in the Running state.
2. JobQueue
	Description: A queue that holds jobs waiting to be executed.
	Functionality:
	Add jobs to the queue.
	Monitor and manage the queue with respect to available worker threads.
	Ensure thread safety with synchronization mechanisms.
3. ThreadPool
	Description: Manages a pool of worker threads.
	Functionality:
		Execute jobs using available threads.
		Limit the number of concurrent threads.
		Reuse threads efficiently and handle job execution.
4. WorkerThread
	Description: A thread dedicated to executing jobs.
	Functionality:
		Fetch jobs from the job queue.
		Execute jobs and manage job states.
		Handle job completion and state transitions.
		
Working Logic
	Initialization:
		Create a JobQueue to hold jobs.
		Instantiate a ThreadPool with a fixed number of worker threads.
		
	Adding Jobs:
		Jobs are added to the JobQueue.
		If there are available threads in the ThreadPool, the job is immediately assigned to a thread.
		If no threads are available, the job waits in the queue until a thread becomes free.
		
	Job Execution:

		Worker threads pick jobs from the queue.
		Each job transitions through its states (Initialization → Waiting → Running → Success/Failure → Cleanup) as it is executed.
		The thread executing the job updates the job’s state and performs the required actions.
		
	Thread Management:

		The ThreadPool manages a fixed number of threads.
		If all threads are busy, new jobs wait in the queue.
		Threads are reused efficiently to avoid overhead.
		
Usage
	Create Jobs			: Define and initialize job objects with specific tasks.
	Add Jobs to Queue	: Use the JobQueue to add jobs.
	Start Job Execution	: The ThreadPool will handle job execution based on available threads.
	Monitor and Manage	: The system will automatically handle thread allocation and job state transitions.
	
Design:
	JobState Interface: Defines a common interface for all job states.
	State Classes: Implement specific actions and transitions for each job state.
	Job Class: Manages state transitions and execution.
	JobQueue Class: Manages a queue of jobs.
	WorkerThread Class: Fetches and processes jobs using a worker thread.
	ThreadPool Class: Manages multiple worker threads.
